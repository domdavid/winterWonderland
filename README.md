  * SnowFlake.java : An example class that includes a paint method which will be called in the Frame.java paint method.
* Installation
  * Eclipse: Import the project into Eclipse as a zip file by downloading the repository as a zip. Alternatively, you can clone the repository in Eclipse using the interface.
  * Non-Eclipse: Start your IDE with a basic Java project. Drag the Frame.java and SnowFlake.java files into the source folder as you would any Java class file.
